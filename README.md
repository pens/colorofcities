# Color of Cities

For full details, visit [my blog post](https://rgb.sh/blog/cities).

This is an art project I built earlier in the quarantine, and only got around to finishing later.
The premise was that every city has a different color palette, and I wanted to take it from there to create representative art of Seattle, Portland and San Francisco to compare them.

Be aware that I hacked this together to get the final output.
The code is inconsistent, makes uninformed use of its imported packages, lacks optimization and was not tested beyond the cities shown here.

## Results
